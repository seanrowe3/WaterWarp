Description:
Water.cpp takes an input image and first flips the image of the x-axis. The image is then 
applied a unique warp that calculates sine and cosine waves on the pixels every 15 pixels.
The sine warp is applied first, then the cosine warp and so on until the bottom of the image
is reached. After this a gaussian blur is applied to the lower half of the image and the 
last five pixel rows of the top half. A simple tonemap is also applied to the same set of
pixels. The last 5 pixel rows of the top half are included to make the water ripple effect
appear more seamless. The code will work with both 3 channel and 4 channel images. 

Press the 'w' key to perform the warp
Press the 's' key to save the new image if specified
Press the 'q' key to quit

water.cpp takes 2 command line arguments: the input image and an optional output image

Usage: 
./water inputimage.jpg [output.jpg]

Known Issues:
The ripple warp appers to grab the lower left corner and put it on the right hand side for 
some reason. The tonemap is relatively simple and does not appear to alter the bottom half
significantly. The blur allows creates a pixel offset on the lower half.
